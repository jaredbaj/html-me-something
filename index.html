    <p>Dungeons &amp Dragons is a fantasy tabletop role-playing game originally designed by Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson. It was first published in 1974 by Tactical Studies Rules, Inc. The game has been published by Wizards of the Coast since 1997.</p>

    <h1>Setting</h1>
    <p>My current setting, Covadun, is a coastal barony set on the northeastern coast of the continent of Vard. Geographically, it's based on Scandinavia and eastern Europe, namely the Balkans. </p>

    <h1>History</h1>
    <p>Covadun used to be part of a larger empire known as Alfar, which was ruled by the elves of the northern expanse. After a time, the humans rebelled against elven rule and drove them into what is now known as Alfgeir. The lands were turned over to a human king, who single-handedly held the lands together. Eventually, a lich rose to power and incited a massive civil war, resulting in the king's death. Heroes from each barony of the kingdom sacrificed themselves to seal the lich away behind the Black Door. In the aftermath, the baronies remain divided and are constantly on the brink of war.</p>

    <h1>Adventure</h1>
    <p>The players begin in village of Watersmeet, which has been overtaken by a foul-smelling mist. The land is currently under rule by the Storm Lord who is a disciple of the Church of Tempus, god of storms and glory, and Watersmeet has recently constructed a temple to Tempus in Watersmeet. When the cemetary's graves are discovered empty and recently dead begin to reanimate and wander off into the woods, the players are enlisted to investigate the source of the necromancy.</p>
